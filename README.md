# go-grpc


### What did I learn new?

- "Accept interface return structs" - see file ![internal/db/rocket.go]
- To run all tests in subdirectories use `go test -race -v ./...` three dots is a special convention that looks into subdirectories
- `go generate` is cool tool to leverage for mocking tests (_unit tests_)
